This release allows performing a combined SOM/SuperSOM clustering of the 640 administrative districts of India.
Fowlkes-Mallows Similarity Index is used to identify robust initializations of the clustering.
Data_India.txt is a specially conceived geographic database of 55 indicators, covering issues of economic activity,
urban structure, socio-demographic development, consumption levels, infrastructure endowment and 
basic geographical positioning within the Indian space. Data refer to 2011 or to 2001-2011 evolutions.
A shapefile of the Indian district is attached allowing to map the results.

v.1.1 contains
- R Script (Robust SOM Clustering v1.1)
- Data set (Data_India.txt)
- Archive of shapefiles for the Indian districts of 2011 (District_2011.zip)
- Fusco G., Perez J., 2015, Spatial Analysis of the Indian Subcontinent: the Complexity Investigated through Neural Networks
- README.txt
